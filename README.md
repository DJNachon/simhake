Forecasting changes in the size-at-maturity of a commercially valuable demersal species under global warming.
                    
As global temperatures rise, the life-history traits of many marine species are changing, with important implications for fish stocks, ecosystems, and fisheries. This study investigates how warming seas influence size-at-maturity—a key indicator of reproductive value and success and then stock productivity—in demersal fish, using the European hake, *Merluccius merluccius* (Linnaeus, 1758), as a representative species. In fish populations, both plastic and genetic adaptations in traits like body size and maturity timing are influenced by fishing pressures and environmental changes. As ectothermic animals, fish rely on external temperatures to regulate physiological processes, making them particularly vulnerable to warming oceans. While shifts in fish distribution and abundance have received considerable attention, changes in size-at-maturity have been less studied. To explore this relationship, we compiled a large dataset spanning from 1925 to 2021, including size-at-maturity records and corresponding temperature data. This dataset covers diverse temperature ranges from the North Atlantic to the Mediterranean, providing a comprehensive look at the hake's habitat. Using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), we identified a consistent negative correlation between temperature and size-at-maturity, aligning with theories like James' Rule and the Temperature-Size Rule (TSR). Under climate change projections (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), our results suggest that size-at-maturity in European hake may decrease by 5–7 cm by 2100. These findings have significant implications not only for European hake, a key fishery resource, but also for other demersal species that may similarly experience reduced size-at-maturity in warming seas. This study highlights the need for adaptive management strategies to address the cascading effects of climate change on marine ecosystems and fisheries sustainability.

**Abstract:** As global temperatures rise, the life-history traits of many marine species are changing, with important implications for fish stocks, ecosystems, and fisheries. This study investigates how warming seas influence size-at-maturity—a key indicator of reproductive value and success and then stock productivity—in demersal fish, using the European hake, *Merluccius merluccius* (Linnaeus, 1758), as a representative species. In fish populations, both plastic and genetic adaptations in traits like body size and maturity timing are influenced by fishing pressures and environmental changes. As ectothermic animals, fish rely on external temperatures to regulate physiological processes, making them particularly vulnerable to warming oceans. While shifts in fish distribution and abundance have received considerable attention, changes in size-at-maturity have been less studied. To explore this relationship, we compiled a large dataset spanning from 1925 to 2021, including size-at-maturity records and corresponding temperature data. This dataset covers diverse temperature ranges from the North Atlantic to the Mediterranean, providing a comprehensive look at the hake's habitat. Using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), we identified a consistent negative correlation between temperature and size-at-maturity, aligning with theories like James' Rule and the Temperature-Size Rule (TSR). Under climate change projections (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), our results suggest that size-at-maturity in European hake may decrease by 5–7 cm by 2100. These findings have significant implications not only for European hake, a key fishery resource, but also for other demersal species that may similarly experience reduced size-at-maturity in warming seas. This study highlights the need for adaptive management strategies to address the cascading effects of climate change on marine ecosystems and fisheries sustainability.
